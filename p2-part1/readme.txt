Project 2: Part 1
Parser Generator

README File
  Instructions to Run:
    g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o a.exe && cat input.txt | .\a.exe

  Conventions:
    We attempted to follow the conventions found in the C++ language documentation.

  Input/Output:
    Our application requires input.
	Please use bash redirection to maintain the EOF symbol.
    Our application prints to stdout & stderr.

  Limitations & Bugs:
    Limitations:
		We are unsure if error handling is fully complete.
		File should have been split into many for organization.
	Bugs:
		No bugs that we know of.

  Completed Functionality:
    These programs are completed and functional as per the spec (ignoring question of correctness regarding error handling).

  Justification of Abstractions, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Design Decisions:
    Our applications use the std library.
	We should have abstracted into more files but time did not permit.
	Algorithms were mostly from lecture, book, or online resources.
